This project provides a simple yet powerful Python script for fetching biological sequences from the NCBI database and performing sequence similarity searches using BLAST, leveraging the capabilities of the Biopython library. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to automate basic bioinformatics workflows.

âœ¨ Features
Sequence Fetching: Retrieve sequences directly from the NCBI 'nuccore' database using accession numbers.
BLAST Search: Perform nucleotide BLAST (blastn) searches against the comprehensive NCBI nucleotide database (nt) via the NCBI web service.
Result Parsing: Parse the XML output from the BLAST search.
Detailed Output: Display key information about significant BLAST hits, including alignment titles, lengths, E-values, scores, identities, gaps, and alignment snippets.
ðŸš€ Prerequisites
To run this script, you need:

Python 3.6 or higher.
The Biopython library.
ðŸ”§ Installation
You can install Biopython using pip:
